6.3 Build Something Fun

Concept:
A (hopefully) simple game similar to "Where's Wally" where the user has to find something in a picture and click on it when it's "found". 

Basic functionality:
The picture will be in a table so the picture can be easily split into different sections and those sections can be assigned css styles. There might be an easier way but that's the direction I thought might work well.

There will be 3 cell states ("default none", "wrong", and "found") that will be executed based on click events. Once the thing is found, the click events will be stopped.

If there's time, I would add:
- a reset button
- an option to play again on other pictures
- change the title of the game when the picture changes
- display different messages in a random order when the cell states are changed
- timer that starts when new picture is loaded and stops when the thing is found.
